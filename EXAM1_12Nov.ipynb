Solve for $\\mathbf{x}$ by calculating the inverse of $A$ (Hint: under https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/routines.linalg.html#solving-equations-and-inverting-matrices you should find the build-in function you are looking for). (1 Point)\n",

Is it the same for the two methods? What does this imply for possibly even larger and thus more complex matrices? (1.5 Points)\n",

Calculate the numerical derivative of the function using the forward finite difference and plot the result next to it (Hint: use a subplot). Choose the step-size $h$ such that the truncation error is 1e-2 at $x=1$. (Hint: the truncation error is $\\epsilon\\sim\\frac{|f^{\\prime\\prime}(x)|}{2}h$). (3 Points)\n",

Using the samples of x with step-size of $10h$, interpolate y using a cubic spline (from scipy.interpolate.CubicSpline: https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.interpolate.CubicSpline.html#scipy.interpolate.CubicSpline). Use the CubicSpline to find the second derivative using step-size $10h$ (Hint: look at the first example under the link). Compare all three numerical derivatives in a figure. What is your conclusion? (3.5 Points)\n",
    "\n",
    "**(e) Extra Point**  Now add a random error of 1\\% to your values of y evaluated with step-size $h$ (Hint: use np.random.normal(y,0.01)). Calculate again the first numerical derivative. Which percentage level is the difference between the new derivative values and the ones from **(c)**? Comment on what is happening. (1 Point)"
